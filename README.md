# Mario_Shader
Simple Shader that automatically applies Airbrush Gradient to tilemap
The Shader should be able to recognize the parameters per object placed and apply shader on top of it, scaling with the object's dimensions. The shader should also be able to change output of second color value by recognizing the base color value.
